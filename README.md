# SQL_Advent_calendar_2025_InterviewMaster
A structured collection of daily SQL challenges from SQL Advent Calendar 2025 by Interview Master. Includes optimized queries, clear logic, and real-world analytical patterns covering joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregations to strengthen SQL problem-solving skills.


## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the SQL Advent Calendar 2025 by Interview Master. The project is focused on building strong SQL fundamentals through daily practice and solving interview-style analytical problems using clean, efficient SQL.

## What This Repository Covers
- Daily SQL challenges solved incrementally
- Real-world data analysis problem patterns
- Clear, readable, and optimized SQL queries

## SQL Concepts Practiced
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD)
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Aggregations and date-based analysis

- Solution query
- Clean formatting for readability

## Why This Project
- To strengthen SQL problem-solving through consistency
- To practice concepts commonly tested in data analyst and BI interviews
- To maintain a structured public SQL portfolio
- To write SQL that is easy to explain and reason about

## Tools Used
- SQL (ANSI-compliant syntax)
- Tested primarily on PostgreSQL (adaptable to MySQL and SQL Server)

## How to Use
1. Open any `Day_XX.sql` file
2. Review the problem statement at the top
3. Run the query in your SQL environment
4. Analyze the logic and approach used

## Progress
- Challenges completed daily as part of SQL Advent Calendar 2025
- Solutions refined for clarity and correctness

## Feedback
Suggestions and improvements are welcome. This repository is maintained as part of my ongoing interview preparation.
