-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select e.elf_name,
  case when v.return_date is null OR v.return_date > CURRENT_DATE then 'still resting'
  else TO_CHAR(v.return_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  end as return_status
from elves e LEFT join vacations v on e.elf_id = v.elf_id;
