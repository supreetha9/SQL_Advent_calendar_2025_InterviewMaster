--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

select prank_id
  FROM(
  select prank_id,
  ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by target_name order by evilness_score DESC,created_at DESC) as rnk
  from grinch_prank_ideas) t
where rnk = 1;
